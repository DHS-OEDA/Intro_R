# Data visualization in R and tidyverse

## base R way

```{r}
# I don't know much about base R plotting, so if you want this section please take it
```


## `ggplot2`

In the `tidyverse` collection there is a package called `ggplot2`. It provides a "grammar of graphics" approach to plotting, where you create plots layer by layer and arrange the plots as you see fit. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(nycflights13)

data(flights)

ggplot(data = flights, aes(x=month)) +
  geom_bar()

```

```{r}
# better, cleaned up version
ggplot(flights, aes(factor(month))) + geom_bar() + ggtitle('NY Flights by Month, 2013') + xlab('Month') + ylab('Count') + theme_minimal()
```
